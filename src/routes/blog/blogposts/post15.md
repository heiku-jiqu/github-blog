When working with sensitive data, it is inevitable to come across cryptography terms scattered here and there, be it for storing data, sharing data, deidentifying data, etc.
This post aggregates some of the common terms that I've come across related to cryptography in the software world, and also how the concepts relate to each other.

## Goals of Cryptography

Confidentiality
Integrity
Authenticity
Availability
Non-repudiation

## Hash / Digest

## Certificate

## Certificate Authority

## Symmetric, Assymetric Algorithms

aka Public key cryptography and Private key cryptography

RSA, SHA, SSL?

## Encryption, Decryption

## Cyphers / Ciphers / Ciphertext

## Plain Text

## Signatures

## Fingerprint

## Private / Public Keys

## Hybrid Systems

## Stream, Block
