Recently read a extremely valuable site on database indexing over at [use-the-index-luke](https://use-the-index-luke.com/).
This post is to synthesise and summarise the main learnings that I took away from the e-book.

# The Three Powers of Indexing

1. B-Tree Traversal
1. Data Clustering
1. Pipelined Sorting

## Data Structures Underlying the Index

**Linked list**

**B-trees**

**Redundant/Duplicated Data**

**Pipelining**

## WHERE clause

## JOIN operations

## ORDER BY and GROUP BY

## Data Clustering

## Partial Results

## INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE

Code:

```css
.grid-container {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(min(200px, 100%), 1fr));
}
```

## Heading 2

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
